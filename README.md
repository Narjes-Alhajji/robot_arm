# robot_arm

#This is the first project that I work with the Smart methods company, which is to create a user interface to control the robotic arms remotely

#In the Arm Robot.html file I programmed the structure for the project which is 6 sliders with 2 buttons
Each slider represents a motor for part of the arm
and 1 button to save
and 1 button to turn on

#In the file Style_arm_robot.css
To format the page

#in arm.php  file
I linked html with php to send data to database

#I created 6 columns for the motors and another column for the start button
If the user presses the (تشغيل) button, the data will be saved in the database and in the play button column the word (on) will be saved.
But if the user presses the (حفظ) button, the data will be saved and the column for the on button will remain off.
